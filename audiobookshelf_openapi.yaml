              The masterpiece that started Terry Goodkind's New York Times bestselling
              epic Sword of Truth In the aftermath of the brutal murder of his father,
              a mysterious woman, Kahlan Amnell, appears in Richard Cypher's forest
              sanctuary seeking help...and more. His world, his very beliefs, are
              shattered when ancient debts come due with thundering violence. In a
              dark age it takes courage to live, and more than mere courage to
              challenge those who hold dominion, Richard and Kahlan must take up that
              challenge or become the next victims. Beyond awaits a bewitching land
              where even the best of their hearts could betray them. Yet, Richard
              fears nothing so much as what secrets his sword might reveal about his
              own soul. Falling in love would destroy them - for reasons Richard can't
              imagine and Kahlan dare not say. In their darkest hour, hunted
              relentlessly, tormented by treachery and loss, Kahlan calls upon Richard
              to reach beyond his sword - to invoke within himself something more
              noble. Neither knows that the rules of battle have just changed...or
              that their time has run out. Wizard's First Rule is the beginning. One
              book. One Rule. Witness the birth of a legend.

              where even the best of their hearts could betray them. Yet, Richard
              fears nothing so much as what secrets his sword might reveal about his
              own soul. Falling in love would destroy them - for reasons Richard can't
              imagine and Kahlan dare not say. In their darkest hour, hunted
              relentlessly, tormented by treachery and loss, Kahlan calls upon Richard
              to reach beyond his sword - to invoke within himself something more
              noble. Neither knows that the rules of battle have just changed...or
              that their time has run out. Wizard's First Rule is the beginning. One
              book. One Rule. Witness the birth of a legend.
